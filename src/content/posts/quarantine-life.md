*Disclaimer*: This post is mostly just me rambling.

The past few months have been different, an almost unrecognizable blur of time and alcohol. In this time, I have thought about different aspects of myself and my life, analyzing what it really means to be "me".

Before COVID-19 and quarantine, my life was still a blur of time, but it lacked the reflection of self that being boarded up at home offers. My weekdays were fairly formulaic:

- Wake up around 6:30 AM
- An hour commute to the downtown SF office
- Work for ~8 hours
- An hour commute back home
- Take care of animals
- Prep/cook dinner
- Watch a movie or a show for ~2 hours
- Go to bed

This was my life. Very monotonous and easy to fall into without much else to throw into the mix. Occasionally I would need to perform duties for work, but for the most part my routine went fairly unscathed. Weekends were more or less binge-watching Netflix or playing Stardew Valley.

Once quarantine began, my schedule more or less became:

- Wake up
- Do some work
- Take care of animals
- Hang out

Things like preparing/cooking dinner were one of the first things that completely fell apart, mostly due to lack of ingredients to make the regularly scheduled meals. One ingredient that was always readily available: vodka. I drank before, but since most of my time required me to be locked up inside, I found myself starting to drink a lot more. I also found myself able to finally catch up on movies and shows that I wanted to watch, since now all I had was time. Eventually, this became the new lifestyle. Basically just work and watch TV, occasionally playing some games on my PlayStation or Switch, and it. Got. Boring. 

Lately I find myself thinking about what it is I value in life, and what was in store for my future. I realized that, until very recently, my life has been owned by others: work, school, commuting, and going out of my way to please everyone in between. I never developed any sense of self, or any _real_ hobbies to decorate the shell of what is me. I've lost huge blocks of time in my life due to the mandates or restrictions imposed by _others_, and it's making me uneasy.

So I've been trying to fix myself, fill my personal void and find an identity that I can comfortably call "me". The problem I've since faced is that I don't exactly have experience outside of my "norm", so I'm basically starting from scratch with everything I do. I also have a problem with trying to understand exactly how something works before I can use it to my satisfaction. I understand that everyone must start somewhere and that learning something new takes time, but it's this very reason why I cannot bring myself to commit. I'm stuck in the cyclic process of wasting time trying to find something to not waste my time.

I've attempted learning new programming languages, finally learning some game development (something I've always wanted to do), and learning some Docker. However, with each new endeavor I find myself learning just enough to scratch the surface, ultimately getting frustrated at how much more I will have to put in. Even now with this blog, I find myself going back through the settings and tweaking things instead of actually writing something, _anything_, down.

**tl;dr**: This blog is my latest venture to help me find my purpose.
