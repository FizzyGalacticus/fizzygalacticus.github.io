# Intro

I am writing this post as a means to try and relieve myself from the dread and despair that lingers within me. I really do not know what will come of out of this, but I do hope that someone can learn something, or potentially shed some light on some things.

# My upbringing

I was raised in the small town of North Pole, Alaska. All of the cheery-ness the name gives aside, I can tell you that it is not easy. There's not a lot going on and the winters are unforgiving. Being such a small town, it wasn't uncommon for everyone to be socially connected in one degree or another. There are folks all over the racial and political spectrums there, but in my experience, everyone understood one simple thing: living in Alaska is no joke.

Sure, _most_ of the year was fairly painless. Snow is annoying, but with temperatures above zero fahrenheit it was manageable. It also helped that there wasn't a terrible amount of humidity. However, I have experienced winters where it reached [-66 degrees fahrenheit](http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/Climate/fairbanks). In these temperatures, without proper supplies and precaution, a person could die in minutes.

So everyone kind of worked together during these harsh periods. People would help each other in times of need. If someone had a flat tire or accidentally landed in the ditch after finding some ice on the road, plenty of others would stop and offer assistance, regardless of either party's race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other distinguishable taxonomy.

# The dive

Before finally getting out, I had visited places outside of Alaska. Almost every place I had visited seemed wonderful -- so much more in each city/town to do and see. There was usually far more than a single street or grocery store. It was awesome! Who _wouldn't_ want to be able to actually have a choice? _This_ was the America that I'd always heard about. An America where you can walk out of your door and walk to one of many restaurants, bars, arcades, concert venues, etc.

I. Was. Hooked.
